# Scan your code with SonarCloud

Using this GitHub Action, scan your code with [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) to detects bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in more than 20 programming languages!

SonarCloud is the leading product for Continuous Code Quality online, totally free for open-source projects. It supports all major programming languages, including C#, VB .Net, JavaScript, TypeScript, C/C++ and many more. If your code is closed source, SonarCloud also offers a paid plan to run private analyses

## Requirements

* Have an account on SonarCloud. [Sign up for free now](https://sonarcloud.io/sessions/init/github) if it's not already the case!
* The repository to analyze is set up on SonarCloud. [Set it up](https://sonarcloud.io/projects/create) in just one click.

## Usage

Project metadata, including the location to the sources to be analyzed, must be declared in the file `sonar-project.properties` in the base directory:

```
sonar.organization=<replace with your SonarCloud organization key>
sonar.projectKey=<replace with the key generated when setting up the project on SonarCloud>

# relative paths to source directories. More details and properties are described
# in https://sonarcloud.io/documentation/project-administration/narrowing-the-focus/ 
sonar.sources=.
```

The workflow, usually declared in `.github/main.workflow`, looks like:

```
workflow "Main Workflow" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = "SonarCloud Trigger"
}

action "SonarCloud Trigger" {
  uses = "sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-action@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN", "SONAR_TOKEN"]
}
```

### Secrets

- `SONAR_TOKEN` â€“ **Required** this is the token used to authenticate access to SonarCloud. You can generate a token on your [Security page in SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/account/security/). You can set the `SONAR_TOKEN` environment variable in the "Secrets" settings page of your repository.

## Example of pull request analysis

## Do not use this GitHub action if you are in the following situations

* Your code is built with Maven: run 'org.sonarsource.scanner.maven:sonar' during the build
* Your code is built with Gradle: use the SonarQube plugin for Gradle during the build
* You want to analyze a .NET solution: use the [SonarCloud Azure DevOps Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarcloud) to analyze your code on SonarCloud with Azure Pipelines
* You want to analyze C/C++ code: rely on our [Travis-CI extension](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/sonarcloud/) and look at [our sample C/C++ project](https://github.com/SonarSource/sq-com_example_c-sqscanner-travis)
